### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an independent OSS developer and in my spare time I work in the creation of libraries that allow the management of offline applications in web and react-native contexts.
I actively follow the GraphQL world with particular attention to Relay.

The main libraries I created are:
 * [relay-hooks](https://github.com/relay-tools/relay-hooks)
 * [react-relay-offline](https://github.com/morrys/react-relay-offline)
 * [relay-angular](https://github.com/morrys/relay-angular)
 * [react-relay-appsync](https://github.com/morrys/react-relay-appsync)
 * [wora/cache-persist](https://medium.com/@morrys/state-persistence-in-javascript-wora-cache-persist-getting-started-27fa4ef6f580)
 * [wora/apollo-offline](https://morrys.github.io/wora/docs/apollo-offline)
 * [wora/relay-offline](https://morrys.github.io/wora/docs/relay-offline)
 * [@types/fbjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/fbjs)
 * [relay-forms](https://github.com/morrys/relay-forms)

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
 * relay-hooks v4.0.0
 * react-relay-offline v3.0.0
 * relay-angular v1.0.0
